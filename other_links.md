# Lipoic acid is 10 times more toxic in cats than reported in humans, dogs or rats

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15059240/

The antioxidant lipoic acid (LA) is administered to humans and pets. We described acute toxicity and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LA in cats. In progression, 10 healthy adult male cats received orally 60 (high), 30 (low), or 0 mg LA/kg (control). Serum enzyme activities and concentrations of bile acids, ammonia, amino acids (AA), LA and dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) were measured, and tissues examined microscopically. Significant clinical toxicity with changes in ammonia and AA concentrations occurred in all high-dose cats. Oral LA produced hepatocellular toxicity and MTD was < 30 mg/kg in cats.

# Human Supplements Toxic to Pets

Cats are ten times more sensitive to alpha lipoic acid toxicity than dogs. Low doses of this supplement could be used therapeutically in pets but great care must be taken to avoid overdosing. In cats a dose of 25 mg daily must not be exceeded. ... Signs of toxicity include drooling, vomiting, ataxia, tremors and seizures. On a blood panel these patients have low glucose, high liver values, imbalances in electrolytes and increased kidney values.

Hydroxycitric acid well tolerated and non-toxic in dogs at 1800 mg/day. Dog weights were 62-96 pounds (28-44 kg). Dose equivalent was 40-64 mg/kg bw.

# Garcinia cambogia extract alters anxiety, sociability, and dopamine turnover in male Swiss albino mice

Two groups of male Swiss albino mice received Garcinia cambogia extract at two different doses, a low and a higher dose (100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg. p.o.). Garcinia cambogia extract have significant anxiogenic effect along with reduced sociability and social novelty in male mice. Moreover, these effects could be related to the altered dopamine turnover and D2 receptor expression in mice brain.

The crude extract or constituents from the plant also exerted hypolipidaemic, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anthelmintic, anticholinesterase and hepatoprotective activities in in vitro and in vivo models.


# Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Oncology

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35564468/

Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, after cardiovascular diseases. Increasing patients' awareness and providing easier access to public information result in greater interest in alternative anticancer or unproven supportive therapies. Fear of cancer and limited trust in the treating physician are also important reasons leading patients to seek these methods. Trust and good communication are essential to achieving truthful collaboration between physicians and patients. Given the popularity of CAM, better knowledge about these alternative practices may help oncologists discuss this issue with their patients. This article objectively reviews the most common unconventional therapies used by cancer patients.
