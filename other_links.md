# Lipoic acid is 10 times more toxic in cats than reported in humans, dogs or rats

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15059240/

The antioxidant lipoic acid (LA) is administered to humans and pets. We described acute toxicity and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LA in cats. In progression, 10 healthy adult male cats received orally 60 (high), 30 (low), or 0 mg LA/kg (control). Serum enzyme activities and concentrations of bile acids, ammonia, amino acids (AA), LA and dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) were measured, and tissues examined microscopically. Significant clinical toxicity with changes in ammonia and AA concentrations occurred in all high-dose cats. Oral LA produced hepatocellular toxicity and MTD was < 30 mg/kg in cats.

# Human Supplements Toxic to Pets

Cats are ten times more sensitive to alpha lipoic acid toxicity than dogs. Low doses of this supplement could be used therapeutically in pets but great care must be taken to avoid overdosing. In cats a dose of 25 mg daily must not be exceeded. ... Signs of toxicity include drooling, vomiting, ataxia, tremors and seizures. On a blood panel these patients have low glucose, high liver values, imbalances in electrolytes and increased kidney values.

# Garcinia cambogia extract alters anxiety, sociability, and dopamine turnover in male Swiss albino mice

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-021-04902-z

Two groups of male Swiss albino mice received Garcinia cambogia extract at two different doses, a low and a higher dose (100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg. p.o.). Garcinia cambogia extract have significant anxiogenic effect along with reduced sociability and social novelty in male mice. Moreover, these effects could be related to the altered dopamine turnover and D2 receptor expression in mice brain.

# Annona Muricata L. extract restores renal function, oxidative stress, immunohistochemical structure, and gene expression of TNF-α, IL-β1, and CYP2E1 in the kidney of DMBA-intoxicated rats

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38362149/

Introduction: 7,12-dimethylbenz (a) anthracene (DMBA) is a harmful polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative known for its cytotoxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic effects in mammals and other species. Annona muricata, L. (Graviola; GRV) is a tropical fruit tree traditionally well-documented for its various medicinal benefits. This investigation is the first report on the potential antioxidant and antinfammatory reno-protective impact of GRV against DMBA-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Methods: Forty male albino rats were allocated into four equal groups (n = 10). The 1st group served as the control, the 2nd group (GRV) was gastro-gavaged with GRV (200 mg/kg b.wt), the 3rd group (DMBA) was treated with a single dose of DMBA (15 mg/kg body weight), and the 4th group (DMBA + GRV) was gastro-gavaged with a single dose of DMBA, followed by GRV (200 mg/kg b.wt). The GRV administration was continued for 8 weeks. Results and Discussion: Results revealed a significant improvement in renal function, represented by a decrease in urea, creatinine, and uric acid (UA) in the DMBA + GRV group. The antioxidant potential of GRV was confirmed in the DMBA + GRV group by a significant decline in malondialdehyde (MDA) and a significant increase in catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S transferase (GST), and reduced glutathione (GSH) compared to DMBA-intoxicated rats; however, it was not identical to the control. Additionally, the antiinflammatory role of GRV was suggested by a significant decline in mRNA expression of cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily e, polypeptide 1 (CYP2E1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) in the DMBA + GRV group. Moreover, GRV improved the histopathologic and immunohistochemical expression of TNF-α, CYP450, and IL1β in DMBA-intoxicated kidney tissue. Conclusively, GRV is a natural medicinal product that can alleviate the renal injury resulting from environmental exposure to DMBA. The reno-protective effects of GRV may involve its anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant properties, which are based on the presence of phytochemical compounds such as acetogenins, alkaloids, and flavonoids.

# Recent Advances in Garcinia cambogia Nutraceuticals in Relation to Its Hydroxy Citric Acid Level. A Comprehensive Review of Its Bioactive Production, Formulation, and Analysis with Future Perspectives

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9352243/

Garcinia cambogia (Gaertn.) Desr. (known as Malabar tamarind) is a popular traditional herbal medicine and is one of the well-known folk medicines reported for the treatment of obesity and incorporated in several nutraceuticals worldwide. These effects are mediated by a myriad of bioactive compounds with most effects attributed to its hydroxy citric acid (HCA) content. This review aims to present a holistic overview on novel trends in the production of G. cambogia bioactive components and how extraction optimization is important to ensure best product quality with its reported nanoformulations with particular emphasis on HCA content. Further, an overview of the different analytical approaches used for quality control assessment of G. cambogia plant and its nutraceuticals is presented highlighting both advantages and limitations. Moreover, analytical approaches for detecting G. cambogia metabolites in biological fluids with emphasis on HCA level to determine its pharmacokinetics and proof of efficacy are presented for the first time.

# Ameliorative Effect of Graviola (Annona muricata) on Mono Sodium Glutamate-Induced Hepatic Injury in Rats: Antioxidant, Apoptotic, Anti-inflammatory, Lipogenesis Markers, and Histopathological Studies

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7693810/

Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a widely used food additive, and there is a trepidation that MSG plays a critical role in multiple hepatic disorders. This study was planned to investigate Graviola extract (GE) effects on hepatic and cellular alterations induced by MSG. Fifty Wistar rats were randomly allocated into five groups: control (received normal saline), Graviola (received 200 mg/kg body weight), MSG (received 2.4 gm MSG/kg, 15% of Lethal dose (LD50) of MSG), Graviola + monosodium glutamate (MSG + GE; received GE, 200 mg/kg/day and MSG 2.4 gm/kg body weight (BW) for the next four weeks), and monosodium glutamate + Graviola (received MSG only (2.4 gm/kg BW) daily for four weeks, then concomitant with Graviola (200 mg/kg BW) daily for the next four weeks. MSG and GR were administered orally for eight weeks. Our results showed that MSG caused a significant increase in oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) level, a tumor protein (P53), hepatic cellular damage, as well as proapoptotic markers caspase-3, and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2)-like protein 4 (Bax). A significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S transferase (GST), reduced glutathione (GSH), and an antiapoptotic agent B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCl-2) was observed. The detected MSG effects were normalized by Graviola administration, either a prophylactic or protecting dose. Besides, Graviola reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and hepatic fatty acid synthase (FAS) and led to the upregulation of the silent information regulator protein one gene expression gene (SIRT1).In conclusion, the results suggest that Gaviola’s interrelated antiapoptotic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties are potential mechanisms to enhance hepatic deficits and protect the liver. Graviola can, therefore, be considered a promising hepatoprotective supplement. Additionally, further human clinical trials are also necessary to validate the present research.



# Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Oncology

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35564468/

Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, after cardiovascular diseases. Increasing patients' awareness and providing easier access to public information result in greater interest in alternative anticancer or unproven supportive therapies. Fear of cancer and limited trust in the treating physician are also important reasons leading patients to seek these methods. Trust and good communication are essential to achieving truthful collaboration between physicians and patients. Given the popularity of CAM, better knowledge about these alternative practices may help oncologists discuss this issue with their patients. This article objectively reviews the most common unconventional therapies used by cancer patients.
