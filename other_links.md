# Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Oncology

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35564468/

Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, after cardiovascular diseases. Increasing patients' awareness and providing easier access to public information result in greater interest in alternative anticancer or unproven supportive therapies. Fear of cancer and limited trust in the treating physician are also important reasons leading patients to seek these methods. Trust and good communication are essential to achieving truthful collaboration between physicians and patients. Given the popularity of CAM, better knowledge about these alternative practices may help oncologists discuss this issue with their patients. This article objectively reviews the most common unconventional therapies used by cancer patients.
