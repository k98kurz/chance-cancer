# Background

On the night of 2021-01-11, as I sat at a bonfire on my best friend's
property in Lehigh Acres, we heard a cat crying in the woods on the other
side of the fence. When we investigated, we found a little orange kitten
about 6-8 weeks old. I jumped the fence about 20 feet away from the kitten,
and he ran up to me and into my arms. We took him inside and bathed him in
the laundry room sink, then dried him with a towel. I took him home and
scheduled his first vet visit. Everyone immediately loved him (except for
my other cat, Minerva). Unfortunately, he had a fungal (ringworm) infection
in his skin, so he had to live in quarantine while I awaited the arrival of
the medicine (it took weeks due to pandemic shortages) and then for the
infection to be resolved (which took about a month). Those two months were
very difficult as he is a very affectionate kitty who has a bit of
separation anxiety. My dad suggested the name Chance because of the random
introduction, and the name stuck.

Eventually, Chance and Minerva started playing and getting along. Together,
they raised a litter of 4 kittens which all found good homes. From the day
the kittens were born, Chance expressed an interest in caring for them,
though of course there was nothing for him to do until they were old
enough to snuggle and play. He was a very caring and affectionate father
to those kittens.

In October 2023, Chance was diagnosed with a sarcoma around his knee in his
left hindleg. Small Animal Hospital performed a lumpectomy on October 25th,
and the histopath report indicated it was an injection-site sarcoma with a
high likelihood of recurrence. On February 8th, I took Chance to SMH for a
check up; the sarcoma had recurred and spread down to his ankle and up into
his pelvis. The vet estimated that extensive surgery (amputation of leg and
partial amputation of pelvis) followed by radiation and chemotherapy would
be required and referred me to Fetch. The vet oncologist at Fetch wanted to
do a CT scan (for $2400) before even talking about therapeutic options and
flatly refused to help with administering the novel chemotherapies I had
found when reading research papers -- he said that he would not even be able
to find any helpful information regarding toxicology, prior clinical cases,
or recent research. Additionally, the information packet provided by Fetch
prior to the consultation emphasized that the best case scenario for their
patients was from a few months up to a year of additional life expectancy
due to their therapeutic methods being incapable of curing cancers, which
is unacceptable when talking about a 3-year old, and there was no way I
would bankrupt myself to merely prolong his suffering.

The initial diagnosis was concerning enough that I began searching pubmed
for information about cancer and novel chemotherapies. I arrived at the
Warburg effect paper describing the metabolic adaptations that make cancers
metastatically aggressive. I looked at some of the papers that cited this
Warburg effect paper and found in vitro and in vivo research pertaining to
alpha lipoic acid, hydroxycitrate, and annonaceous acetogenins (I had also
previously heard a clinical case involving extracts of the American pawpaw
plant, which contains these acetogenins).

After the disappointing visit with Fetch, I began searching for toxicology
data for ALA, hydroxycitrate/hydroxycitric acid, graviola/soursop (Annona
muricata), American pawpaw (Asimina triloba), and annonacin and other
acetogenins. The goal is to develop and administer a chemotherapy regime
starting with ALA at a low dose, increasing the dose up to a therapeutic
level after confirming its nontoxicity, and adding calcium hydroxycitrate
and extracts of pawpaw or graviola in a similar manner until remission
occurs.

Before beginning treatment, Chance weighed about 6kg. Calculations used a
5kg bodyweight model.

I have contacted the ASPCA for information from their AnTox databank and
the UF Center for Environmental and Human Toxicology: ASPCA responded to
phone calls and requested I send an email; UF CEHT never once answered
the phone, so I used their contact form. I sent the same letter to each:
[toxicology email](2024-02-26-toxicology-email.txt). I am awaiting response
from both but will work on obtaining the necessary chemical agents in the
meantime.

# 2024-02-27

Responded to email response from Marianne Kozuch, Ph.D. at the Analytical
Toxicology Core Laboratory, University of Florida, including clarification
on what I envison studies to look like and what background reading I have
done (included links to 23 papers).

Began work on dosing methods/schedules:
- [ALA](methods-and-schedules/alpha-lipoic-acid.md)
- [Hydroxycitrate](methods-and-schedules/hydroxycitrate.md)
- [Graviola](methods-and-schedules/annonaceous-acetogenins.md)
- [Warburg Trap](methods-and-schedules/warburg-trap.md)

# 2024-02-28

Completed initial dosing schedule.

Email correspondence with Dr. Marianne Kozuch concluded. Her department
does not have any information useful for this project.

# 2024-02-29

Fed Chance 10 mg Garcinia cambogia with wet food around 9:30pm. No signs of
adverse effects. The Garcinia cambogia extract came in pill form; I had to
grind off bits with a steak knife, scoop up the dust/grit, and measure it.

# 2024-03-01

Took Chance to vet in morning for blood test and steroid injection in case
the anthelmintic effects kill the heartworm and cause problems. (He received
"Dexamethasone Injectable 2mg/cc/100 ml".) Steroid treatment should be good
for 5 days, so I decided to change the dose schedule to start the Annona
muricata before the ALA.

Also decided that dose schedule should be shortened to an increase in all 3
at the same time instead of one at a time after initial introduction. The new
protocol will be to revert to the previous dosage if a blood test shows signs
of organ stress and continue backtracking until the blood tests are good again,
then go one at a time with the dose increases to find the maximum tolerated
dose of each (assuming it is below the expected therapeutic dose).

Found a paper with a report of Garcinia cambogia in cats: 45mg/kg bw/day for
6 months with no reported adverse effects (8 cats of same breed). Increased
dose schedule for Garcinia cambogia to target a final dose of 240mg
(~40mg/kg bw/day) from the original 60mg (~10mg/kg bw/day).

Fed Chance 20mg Garcinia cambogia extract with wet food around 11:50pm. Also
measured out 31mg and placed in a plastic cup with lid for tomorrow.

Decided that ALA and Annona muricata should be introduced simultaneously to
further shorten the schedule and save on blood testing costs. Original plan was
too cautious and not aggressive enough considering the stage of the cancer. If
the doses do not prove effective, I will increase Annona muricata cautiously
with further testing.

# 2024-03-02

Reviewed notes on ALA. Therapeutic dose needs to be 8mg/kg BW/day, which is 48mg
total, not 8mg total. Fixed dosing schedule.

Fed Chance the previously-measured 31mg of Carginia cambogia extract with wet
food around 10:30pm.

# 2024-03-03

Ground up the remainder of the previously-used Garcinia cambogia with a mortar
and pestle I acquired yesterday after following the directions for mortar
prepation (hand wash with light dish soap, air dry, then grind up a small amount of
rice 5 times, hand wash with light dish soap, then air dry).

Measured the number of drops (H2O) per mL using 20 plastic transfer pipettes
selected at random from the box. The result was 28.44 +/-0.49 (95%, t-dist with
df=19).

Measured out 13mg Annona muricata extract and mixed into 1mL of Sam's bottled water
using pipette to both measure and mix. Result was more mixture than solution, and its
volume was measured as 26 drops using the same pipette. Schedule called for 3 doses of
1mg, 3 doses of 2mg, and 1 dose of 4mg. These were measured out with drops at 2 drops
per mg, and the resulting doses were put in plastic cups with lids labeled with
"A.m. {x}mg" where x was the dose. Unused doses were put in the refrigerator.

Measured 30mg of Garcinia cambogia. Added with a 1mg Annona muricata measured as
described above to wet food and fed to Chance half an hour past midnight, technically
on 2024-03-04. (Calibration took longer than I anticipated.)

# 2024-03-04
Measured 30mg Garcinia cambogia and 6mg ALA (decided to skip the solvent because it is
not worth the hassle for 3 doses; just measured with scale). Combined with 1mg Annona
muricata extract dose measured previously. Fed to Chance mixed into wet food a half
hour after midnight, technically on 2024-03-05. Used an additional drop of filtered
water to dilute the Annona muricata extract mixture to reduce the amount lost to
water adhesion.

# 2024-03-05

Measured 30mg Garcinia cambogia and 6mg ALA. Combined with 1mg Annona muricata extract
dose measured previously. Fed to Chance mixed into wet food around 11:20pm. Used an
additional drop of filtered water to dilute the Annona muricata extract mixture to
reduce the amount lost to water adhesion.

Prepared future doses for convenience over the next few days:
- 2024-03-06: 60mg G.c., 6mg ALA, 2mg A.m.
- 2024-03-07: 60mg G.c., 12mg ALA, 2mg A.m.
- 2024-03-08: 60mg G.c., 12mg ALA, 2mg A.m.
- 2024-03-09: 60mg G.c., 12mg ALA, 4mg A.m.
- 2024-03-10: 120mg G.c., 12mg ALA, 4mg A.m.
- 2024-03-11: 120mg G.c., 24mg ALA, 4mg A.m.
- 2024-03-12: 120mg G.c., 24mg ALA, 6mg A.m.

The Annona muricata for 03-06 through 03-09 were previously measured. The remaining
doses were measured by combining 1mL filtered water with 14mg A.m. extract powder; the
resulting mixture was measured in drops, and additional filtered water was added to
bring the total number of drops to 28; 2 drops were then used per mg of intended dose.

Doses were combined into wet food in plastic cups labeled with the date and doses, then
refrigerated.

# 2024-03-06

technically on 03-14. Also measured out doses for 2024-03-14 through 2024-03-19, mixed with
wet food, and placed in the refrigerator in marked plastic cups with matchin label lids.
Note: the first 4 measurements of A.m. (6, 6, 6, and 8mg) were done dry; the final 3 doses
were measured by mixing 24mg with filtered water and distributing evenly with drops from a
transfer pipette.

He will fast after midnight in preparation for tomorrow's appointment.

# 2024-03-27

Took Chance to UF Small Animal Hospital for an exam and discussion with the surgical
oncologist. They had a similar case a few months earlier in which all the interventions
failed. I was told to expect a teleconference with medical oncology in the near future.

Measured another 240/48/10 dose and fed it to Chance mixed into wet food at 11:00pm.

with wet food at 12:55am that night, technically on 04-04.

# 2024-04-04

Added 16mg to each of the 21 remaining doses measured out two days prior and fed one to Chance
mixed with wet food at midnight, technically on 04-05.

Also weighed 14 Garcinia cambogia extract pills and found that they had a mean mass of 1290.7mg
and a standard deviation of 37.5mg. (Raw data: 1285, 1304, 1314, 1215, 1239, 1266, 1303, 1333,
1255, 1337, 1284, 1296, 1346, 1293.)

Left instructions with the caretaker before I began my cross-country journey.

# 2024-04-23

Returned from journey after caretaker had already fed Chance his dose for the day. Caretaker
said there were no problems getting him to eat his medicated food. I noticed that he seems a
bit slimmer, and there is one new (or more likely just now noticeable) tumor on the right side
of the pelvis. Chance moves a bit slower than he did prior to my journey.

# 2024-04-24

Fed Chance the last dose measured prior to the journey. He did not want to eat the whole thing in
one sitting.

# 2024-04-25

Measured out a 240/48/18 dose and fed it to Chance mixed into his wet food just past midnight,
technically on 2024-04-26. He struggled to eat it all and left a small amount behind.

# 2024-04-26

Call from UF medical oncology with Dr. Calahan and Dr. Simon.

- Surgery is not a good option
- Radiation is not very effective for large tumors -- not expected to work for this sarcoma
- Drugs that may be effective (chemotherapies):
  - Lomustine (CCNU) -- can be toxic; dose once every 4-6 weeks; closely monitor blood cells (bone marrow suppression)
    - Can cause some tumor remission for a brief period in a quarter of patients
    - Tumor growth returns after a few months
  - Doxorubicin -- given once every 3 weeks; higher percentage of side effects in cats (~20%)
    - Can cause some tumor remission for a brief period in a quarter of patients
    - Cat kidneys are especially sensitive
- Monensin: mostly used for bovine protozoan parasites; used in the past for cat toxoplasma
- Octreotide: safe to use in cats; used to suppress hormone secretions in some tumors
  - Reference dosing: every 8 hours (3x a day) for long term hormone secretion suppression (subcutaneous injectable, increase dose over time)
- Fenofibrate: safe to use in cats; used to treat lipid metabolism disease (upregulates lipases)
  - Reference dosing (dogs): daily oral application
- Paliative options for treating the tumors symptomatically as the disease progresses
- Warburg effect: solid tumors like sarcomas can selectively choose metabolic pathways, but it is different than in human medicine
- Cellular metabolism is similar, but drug metabolism is different
  - Basic mechanisms are very similar (mitochondria, electron transport chains, etc)
  - e.g. cats cannot enzymatically activate prednisone
  - Some chemotherapies used in dogs cannot be used in cats
  - Some additional toxicity issues in cats
  - CCNU is metabolized more slowly in cats than in dogs
- $400-600 estimated per chemotherapy visit
- Look up drugs on www.nlm.nih.gov

# 2024-06-14

Took Chance to SAH. The vet said the next step would be a hemipelvic
amputation if ultrasound showed the sarcoma had not spread across the pelvis
or infiltrated any organs. I rechecked the right pelvis after returning home
and found that whatever mass I had felt on 2024-04-23 is gone; however, the
extent of tumor growth and spread in the left leg and left side of the pelvis
is catastrophic.

I contacted VCA in West Palm Beach and UF for estimates; VCA provided estimate
for the ultrasound consultation but did not provide any estimate for surgery or
euthanasia; UF said they will send estimates on Monday. Also called SAH for an
estimate and brief explanation of the euthanasia procedure.

Based on the estimate for ultrasound alone, treatment will likely be
prohibitively expensive. The only options at that point will be to attempt the
Warburg Trap chemicals (with THC to reduce pain and promote appteite) or euthanasia.

Did not attempt to feed the G.c.+ALA+A.m. tumor suppressant mixture.
