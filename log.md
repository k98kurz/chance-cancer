# Background

On the night of 2021-01-11, as I sat at a bonfire on my best friend's
property in Lehigh Acres, we heard a cat crying in the woods on the other
side of the fence. When we investigated, we found a little orange kitten
about 6-8 weeks old. I jumped the fence about 20 feet away from the kitten,
and he ran up to me and into my arms. We took him inside and bathed him in
the laundry room sink, then dried him with a towel. I took him home and
scheduled his first vet visit. Everyone immediately loved him (except for
my other cat, Minerva). Unfortunately, he had a fungal (ringworm) infection
in his skin, so he had to live in quarantine while I awaited the arrival of
the medicine (it took weeks due to pandemic shortages) and then for the
infection to be resolved (which took about a month). Those two months were
very difficult as he is a very affectionate kitty who has a bit of
separation anxiety. My dad suggested the name Chance because of the random
introduction, and the name stuck.

Eventually, Chance and Minerva started playing and getting along. Together,
they raised a litter of 4 kittens which all found good homes. From the day
the kittens were born, Chance expressed an interest in caring for them,
though of course there was nothing for him to do until they were old
enough to snuggle and play. He was a very caring and affectionate father
to those kittens.

In October 2023, Chance was diagnosed with a sarcoma around his knee in his
left hindleg. Small Animal Hospital performed a lumpectomy on October 25th,
and the histopath report indicated it was an injection-site sarcoma with a
high likelihood of recurrence. On February 8th, I took Chance to SMH for a
check up; the sarcoma had recurred and spread down to his ankle and up into
his pelvis. The vet estimated that extensive surgery (amputation of leg and
partial amputation of pelvis) followed by radiation and chemotherapy would
be required and referred me to Fetch. The vet oncologist at Fetch wanted to
do a CT scan (for $2400) before even talking about therapeutic options and
flatly refused to help with administering the novel chemotherapies I had
found when reading research papers -- he said that he would not even be able
to find any helpful information regarding toxicology, prior clinical cases,
or recent research. Additionally, the information packet provided by Fetch
prior to the consultation emphasized that the best case scenario for their
patients was from a few months up to a year of additional life expectancy
due to their therapeutic methods being incapable of curing cancers, which
is unacceptable when talking about a 3-year old, and there was no way I
would bankrupt myself to merely prolong his suffering.

The initial diagnosis was concerning enough that I began searching pubmed
for information about cancer and novel chemotherapies. I arrived at the
Warburg effect paper describing the metabolic adaptations that make cancers
metastatically aggressive. I looked at some of the papers that cited this
Warburg effect paper and found in vitro and in vivo research pertaining to
alpha lipoic acid, hydroxycitrate, and annonaceous acetogenins (I had also
previously heard a clinical case involving extracts of the American pawpaw
plant, which contains these acetogenins).

After the disappointing visit with Fetch, I began searching for toxicology
data for ALA, hydroxycitrate/hydroxycitric acid, graviola/soursop (Annona
muricata), American pawpaw (Asimina triloba), and annonacin and other
acetogenins. The goal is to develop and administer a chemotherapy regime
starting with ALA at a low dose, increasing the dose up to a therapeutic
level after confirming its nontoxicity, and adding calcium hydroxycitrate
and extracts of pawpaw or graviola in a similar manner until remission
occurs.

I have contacted the ASPCA for information from their AnTox databank and
the UF Center for Environmental and Human Toxicology: ASPCA responded to
phone calls and requested I send an email; UF CEHT never once answered
the phone, so I used their contact form. I sent the same letter to each:
[toxicology email](2024-02-26-toxicology-email.txt). I am awaiting response
from both but will work on obtaining the necessary chemical agents in the
meantime.

Responded to email response from Marianne Kozuch, Ph.D. at the Analytical
Toxicology Core Laboratory, University of Florida, including clarification
on what I envison studies to look like and what background reading I have
done (included links to 23 papers).

Began work on dosing methods/schedules:
- [ALA](methods-and-schedules/alpha-lipoic-acid.md)
- [Hydroxycitrate](methods-and-schedules/hydroxycitrate.md)
- [Graviola](methods-and-schedules/annonaceous-acetogenins.md)
- [Warburg Trap](methods-and-schedules/warburg-trap.md)
