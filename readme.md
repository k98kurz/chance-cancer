# Summary

My cat, Chance, has a sarcoma in his left hind leg that recurred a few months
after surgical removal (lumpectomy). I did a significant amount of reading of
peer-reviewed research papers and discovered several experimental and
potentially effective chemotherapies: hydroxycitric acid (from Garcinia
cambogia), alpha lipoic acid, and annonaceous acetogenins (from Annona muricata
and Asimina triloba). After finding what information I could about the safety
of these for consumption by cats, I constructed a dosing schedule and some
simple methods for measurement and medical application. The dose schedule
included a safety trial period in which several blood tests were done to ensure
the non-toxicity of the treatment as the doses were ramped up. Any further
changes, e.g. to introduce new medicines, will follow a similarly cautious
procedure.

The log of actions taken, as well as a background narrative, can be found in
[log.md](https://github.com/k98kurz/chance-cancer/blob/master/log.md). The
following files are pertinent for current methods and doses:
- methods-and-schedules/dose-schedule.ods
- methods-and-schedules/alpha-lipoic-acid.md
- methods-and-schedules/annonaceous-acetogenins.md
- methods-and-schedules/hydroxycitrate.md

Additional medical schedules may be developed if the current ones prove
ineffective.

My notes from my reading can be found in
[cancer-treatments.md](https://github.com/k98kurz/chance-cancer/blob/master/cancer-treatments.md)
and [other_links.md](https://github.com/k98kurz/chance-cancer/blob/master/other_links.md).

A number of pdfs for relevant papers can be found in the
