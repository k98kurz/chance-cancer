# Background: The Warburg Effect

## Otto Warburg's contributions to current concepts of cancer metabolism

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21508971/

Otto Warburg pioneered quantitative investigations of cancer cell metabolism, as well as photosynthesis and respiration. Warburg and co-workers showed in the 1920s that, under aerobic conditions, tumour tissues metabolize approximately tenfold more glucose to lactate in a given time than normal tissues, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. However, this increase in aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells is often erroneously thought to occur instead of mitochondrial respiration and has been misinterpreted as evidence for damage to respiration instead of damage to the regulation of glycolysis. In fact, many cancers exhibit the Warburg effect while retaining mitochondrial respiration. We re-examine Warburg's observations in relation to the current concepts of cancer metabolism as being intimately linked to alterations of mitochondrial DNA, oncogenes and tumour suppressors, and thus readily exploitable for cancer therapy.

## The Warburg Effect Explained: Integration of Enhanced Glycolysis with Heterogeneous Mitochondria to Promote Cancer Cell Proliferation

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37958775/

The Warburg effect is the long-standing riddle of cancer biology. How does aerobic glycolysis, inefficient in producing ATP, confer a growth advantage to cancer cells? A new evaluation of a large set of literature findings covering the Warburg effect and its yeast counterpart, the Crabtree effect, led to an innovative working hypothesis presented here. It holds that enhanced glycolysis partially inactivates oxidative phosphorylation to induce functional rewiring of a set of TCA cycle enzymes to generate new non-canonical metabolic pathways that sustain faster growth rates. The hypothesis has been structured by constructing two metabolic maps, one for cancer metabolism and the other for the yeast Crabtree effect. New lines of investigation, suggested by these maps, are discussed as instrumental in leading toward a better understanding of cancer biology in order to allow the development of more efficient metabolism-targeted anticancer drugs.

## The Warburg Effect and the Hallmarks of Cancer

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27804847/

It is a longstanding debate whether cancer is one disease or a set of very diverse diseases. The goal of this paper is to suggest strongly that most of (if not all) the hallmarks of cancer could be the consequence of the Warburg's effect. As a result of the metabolic impairment of the oxidative phosphorylation, there is a decrease in ATP concentration. To compensate the reduced energy yield, there is massive glucose uptake, anaerobic glycolysis, with an up-regulation of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway resulting in increased biosynthesis leading to increased cell division and local pressure. This increased pressure is responsible for the fractal shape of the tumor, the secretion of collagen by the fibroblasts and plays a critical role in metastatic spread. The massive extrusion of lactic acid contributes to the extracellular acidity and the activation of the immune system. The decreased oxidative phosphorylation leads to impairment in CO2 levels inside and outside the cell, with increased intracellular alkalosis and contribution of carbonic acid to extracellular acidosis-mediated by at least two cancer-associated carbonic anhydrase isoforms. The increased intracellular alkalosis is a strong mitogenic signal, which bypasses most inhibitory signals. Mitochondrial disappearance (such as seen in very aggressive tumors) is a consequence of mitochondrial swelling, itself a result of decreased ATP concentration. The transmembrane pumps, which extrude, from the mitochondria, ions, and water, are ATP-dependant. Therapy aiming at increasing both the number and the efficacy of mitochondria could be very useful.

## The Warburg effect on radioresistance: Survival beyond growth

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37726064/

The Warburg effect is a phenomenon in which cancer cells rely primarily on glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation, even in the presence of oxygen. Although evidence of its involvement in cell proliferation has been discovered, the advantages of the Warburg effect in cancer cell survival under treatment have not been fully elucidated. In recent years, the metabolic characteristics of radioresistant cancer cells have been evaluated, enabling an extension of the original concept of the Warburg effect. In this review, we focused on the role of the Warburg effect in redox homeostasis and DNA damage repair, two critical factors contributing to radioresistance. In addition, we highlighted the metabolic involvement in the radioresistance of cancer stem cells, which is the root cause of tumor recurrence. Finally, we summarized radiosensitizing drugs that target the Warburg effect. Insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the Warburg effect and radioresistance can provide valuable information for developing strategies to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and provide future directions for successful cancer therapy.

## The Warburg Effect 97 Years after Its Discovery

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33008042/

The deregulation of the oxidative metabolism in cancer, as shown by the increased aerobic glycolysis and impaired oxidative phosphorylation (Warburg effect), is coordinated by genetic changes leading to the activation of oncogenes and the loss of oncosuppressor genes. The understanding of the metabolic deregulation of cancer cells is necessary to prevent and cure cancer. In this review, we illustrate and comment the principal metabolic and molecular variations of cancer cells, involved in their anomalous behavior, that include modifications of oxidative metabolism, the activation of oncogenes that promote glycolysis and a decrease of oxygen consumption in cancer cells, the genetic susceptibility to cancer, the molecular correlations involved in the metabolic deregulation in cancer, the defective cancer mitochondria, the relationships between the Warburg effect and tumor therapy, and recent studies that reevaluate the Warburg effect. Taken together, these observations indicate that the Warburg effect is an epiphenomenon of the transformation process essential for the development of malignancy.

## Revisiting the Warburg effect: historical dogma versus current understanding

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33347611/

Contrary to Warburg's original thesis, accelerated aerobic glycolysis is not a primary, permanent and universal consequence of dysfunctional or impaired mitochondria compensating for poor ATP yield per mole of glucose. Instead, in most tumours the Warburg effect is an essential part of a 'selfish' metabolic reprogramming, which results from the interplay between (normoxic/hypoxic) hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) overexpression, oncogene activation (cMyc, Ras), loss of function of tumour suppressors (mutant p53, mutant phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), microRNAs and sirtuins with suppressor functions), activated (PI3K-Akt-mTORC1, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK-cMyc, Jak-Stat3) or deactivated (LKB1-AMPK) signalling pathways, components of the tumour microenvironment, and HIF-1 cooperation with epigenetic mechanisms. Molecular and functional processes of the Warburg effect include: (a) considerable acceleration of glycolytic fluxes; (b) adequate ATP generation per unit time to maintain energy homeostasis and electrochemical gradients; (c) backup and diversion of glycolytic intermediates facilitating the biosynthesis of nucleotides, non-essential amino acids, lipids and hexosamines; (d) inhibition of pyruvate entry into mitochondria; (e) excessive formation and accumulation of lactate, which stimulates tumour growth and suppression of anti-tumour immunity - in addition, lactate can serve as an energy source for normoxic cancer cells and drives malignant progression and resistances to conventional therapies; (f) cytosolic lactate being mainly exported through upregulated lactate-proton symporters (MCT4), working together with other H+ transporters, and carbonic anhydrases (CAII, CAIX), which hydrate CO2 from oxidative metabolism to form H+ and bicarbonate; (g) these proton export mechanisms, in concert with poor vascular drainage, being responsible for extracellular acidification, driving malignant progression and resistance to conventional therapies; (h) maintenance of the cellular redox homeostasis and low reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation; and (i) HIF-1 overexpression, mutant p53 and mutant PTEN, which inhibit mitochondrial biogenesis and functions, negatively impacting cellular respiration rate. The glycolytic switch is an early event in oncogenesis and primarily supports cell survival. All in all, the Warburg effect, i.e. aerobic glycolysis in the presence of oxygen and - in principle - functioning mitochondria, constitutes a major driver of the cancer progression machinery, resistance to conventional therapies, and poor patient outcome. However, as evidenced during the last two decades, in a minority of tumours primary mitochondrial defects can play a key role promoting the Warburg effect and tumour progression due to mutations in some Krebs cycle enzymes and mitochondrial ROS overproduction.



# Treatment 1: alpha lipoic acid and hydroxycitrate

## α-Lipoic acid inhibits human lung cancer cell proliferation through Grb2-mediated EGFR downregulation

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28993193/

Results: α -LA dramatically decreased NSCLC cell proliferation by downregulating Grb2; in contrast, Grb2 overexpression significantly prevented α-LA-induced decrease in cell growth in vitro. Western blot analysis indicated that α-LA decreased the levels of phospho-EGFR, CDK2/4/6, Cyclins D3 and E1, which are associated with the inhibition of G1/S-phase transition. Additional experiments indicated that Grb2 inhibition partially abolished EGF-induced phospho-EGFR and phospho-ERK1/2 activity. In addition, α-LA exerted greater inhibitory effects than gefitinib on NSCLC cells by preventing EGF-induced EGFR activation.

Conclusion: For the first time, these findings provide the first evidence that α-LA inhibits cell proliferation through Grb2 by suppressing EGFR phosphorylation and that MAPK/ERK is involved in this pathway.


## α-lipoic acid modulates prostate cancer cell growth and bone cell differentiation

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38388663/

Prostate cancer (PCa) progression leads to bone modulation in approximately 70% of affected men. A nutraceutical, namely, α-lipoic acid (α-LA), is known for its potent anti-cancer properties towards various cancers and has been implicated in treating and promoting bone health. Our study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism behind the role of α-LA as therapeutics in preventing PCa and its associated bone modulation. Notably, α-LA treatment significantly reduced the cell viability, migration, and invasion of PCa cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, α-LA supplementation dramatically increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and HIF-1α expression, which started the downstream molecular cascade and activated JNK/caspase-3 signaling pathway. Flow cytometry data revealed the arrest of the cell cycle in the S-phase, which has led to apoptosis of PCa cells. Furthermore, the results of ALP (Alkaline phosphatase) and TRAP (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) staining signifies that α-LA supplementation diminished the PCa-mediated differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively, in the MC3T3-E1 and bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) cells. In summary, α-LA supplementation enhanced cellular apoptosis via increased ROS levels, HIF-1α expression, and JNK/caspase-3 signaling pathway in advanced human PCa cell lines. Also, the treatment of α-LA improved bone health by reducing PCa-mediated bone cell modulation.


## α-Lipoic Acid Targeting PDK1/NRF2 Axis Contributes to the Apoptosis Effect of Lung Cancer Cells

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34211631/

As an antioxidant, α-lipoic acid (LA) has attracted much attention to cancer research. However, the exact mechanism of LA in cancer progression control and prevention remains to be unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that α-lipoic acid has inhibitory effects on the proliferation, migration, and proapoptotic effects of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines A549 and PC9. LA-induced NSCLC cell apoptosis was mediated by elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Further study confirmed that it is by downregulating the expression of PDK1 (the PDH kinase), resulted in less phospho-PDH phenotype which could interact with Keap1, the negative controller of NRF2, directly leading to NRF2 decrease. Thus, by downregulating the NRF2 antioxidant system, LA plays a role in promoting apoptosis through the ROS signaling pathway. Moreover, LA could enhance other PDK inhibitors with the proapoptosis effect. In summary, our study shows that LA promotes apoptosis and exerts its antitumor activity against lung cancer by regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism enzyme-related antioxidative stress system. Administration of LA to the tumor-bearing animal model further supported the antitumor effect of LA. These findings provided new ideas for the clinical application of LA in the field of cancer therapy.

### Animal model: 2.5. LA Inhibits Lung Carcinoma via Reducing PDK1 and NRF2 Expression In Vivo

To further demonstrate the anticancer effects of LA in vivo and the inhibition of NRF2 and PDK1, a tumor-bearing mouse (C57BL/6, black) model was constructed. Compared to the control group, intraperitoneal administration of LA (91 mg/kg) could significantly decrease the size (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)) and weight (Figure 5(c)) of the tumors formed by LLC cells (mouse lung cancer cells). In addition, the mice were tolerant to LA at the concentration used (Figure 5(d)).


## Alpha-lipoic acid inhibits lung cancer growth via mTOR-mediated autophagy inhibition

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32090494/

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death, and there remains a need for novel therapies for this malignancy. Here, we examined the effects of alpha-lipoic acid (LA), a drug used for treating human diabetic complications, on lung cancer growth. We report that LA limited lung cancer growth in xenograft mice and reduced lung cancer A549 cell viability. We observed autophagy activation in human lung cancers, and report that LA inactivated autophagy in A549 cells. In addition, LA activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6K signaling. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin reversed LA-induced inactivation of autophagy and abolished LA-induced suppression of A549 cell viability. Altogether, the data suggest that LA exerts an anti-lung cancer effect through mTOR-mediated inhibition of autophagy, and thus LA may have therapeutic potential for lung cancer management.


## Out of Warburg effect: An effective cancer treatment targeting the tumor specific metabolism and dysregulated pH

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28122260/

As stated by Otto Warburg nearly a century ago, cancer is a metabolic disease, a fermentation caused by malfunctioning mitochondria, resulting in increased anabolism and decreased catabolism. Treatment should, therefore, aim at restoring the energy yield. To decrease anabolism, glucose uptake should be reduced (ketogenic diet). To increase catabolism, the oxidative phosphorylation should be restored. Treatment with a combination of α-lipoic acid and hydroxycitrate has been shown to be effective in multiple animal models. This treatment, in combination with conventional chemotherapy, has yielded extremely encouraging results in glioblastoma, brain metastasis and lung cancer. Randomized trials are necessary to confirm these preliminary data. The major limitation is the fact that the combination of α-lipoic acid and hydroxycitrate can only be effective if the mitochondria are still present and/or functional. That may not be the case in the most aggressive tumors. The increased intracellular alkalosis is a strong mitogenic signal, which bypasses most inhibitory signals. Concomitant correction of this alkalosis may be a very effective treatment in case of mitochondrial failure.


## A combination of alpha lipoic acid and calcium hydroxycitrate is efficient against mouse cancer models: preliminary results

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20372858/

The impact of metabolic dysregulation on tumor development has long been established. We have targeted two enzymes that are altered during carcinogenesis: pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which is down-regulated, and ATP citrate lyase, which is overexpressed in cancer cells. Alpha lipoic acid is a cofactor of PDH, while hydroxycitrate is a known inhibitor of ATP citrate lyase. Our hypothesis is that a combination of these drugs may have antitumoral potential. The efficacy of these molecules was screened in vitro by treatment of different human cancer and murine cell lines. Lipoic acid reduced the cell number by 10-50% depending on concentrations (0.1-10 microM) and cell types. Calcium hydroxycitrate reduced the cell number by 5-60% at different concentrations (10-500 microM). When hydroxycitrate and lipoic acid were used together, there was a major cytotoxic effect: complete cell death was seen following 8 microM lipoic acid and 300 microM hydroxycitrate treatment for 72 h. The combination of alpha lipoic acid and hydroxycitrate was administered to healthy mice, at doses currently utilized for other indications than cancer; no demonstrable toxicity was observed. The combination was used to treat mouse syngenic cancer models: MBT-2 bladder transitional cell carcinoma, B16-F10 melanoma and LL/2 Lewis lung carcinoma. The efficacy of this combination appears similar to conventional chemotherapy (cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil) as it resulted in significant tumor growth retardation and enhanced survival. This preliminary study suggests that this combination of drugs is efficient against cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. A clinical trial is warranted.


## Tumor regression with a combination of drugs interfering with the tumor metabolism: efficacy of hydroxycitrate, lipoic acid and capsaicin

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22797854/

Cellular metabolic alterations are now well described as implicated in cancer and some strategies are currently developed to target these different pathways. In previous papers, we demonstrated that a combination of molecules (namely alpha-lipoic acid and hydroxycitrate, i.e. Metabloc™) targeting the cancer metabolism markedly decreased tumor cell growth in mice. In this work, we demonstrate that the addition of capsaicin further delays tumor growth in mice in a dose dependant manner. This is true for the three animal model tested: lung (LLC) cancer, bladder cancer (MBT-2) and melanoma B16F10. There was no apparent side effect of this ternary combination. The addition of a fourth drug (octreotide) is even more effective resulting in tumor regression in mice bearing LLC cancer. These four compounds are all known to target the cellular metabolism not its DNA. The efficacy, the apparent lack of toxicity, the long clinical track records of these medications in human medicine, all points toward the need for a clinical trial. The dramatic efficacy of treatment suggests that cancer may simply be a disease of dysregulated cellular metabolism.


## New Cancer Paradigm and New Treatment: The Example of METABLOC

Note: this is a Hindawi Special Issue, not a regular journal article, and should be approached with suspicion.

https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cpis/2013/827686/

Hyperthermia has long been known to interfere with the tumor metabolism. The goal of this paper is to review the potential of metabolic therapy and to suggest that its combination with hyperthermia may be of interest.

### Result

Tumor regression and double life expectancy compared to control.


## Alpha-Lipoic Acid and Glucose Metabolism: A Comprehensive Update on Biochemical and Therapeutic Features

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36615676/

Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a natural compound with antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties which has effects on the regulation of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. ALA is widely prescribed in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy due to its positive effects on nerve conduction and alleviation of symptoms. It is, moreover, also prescribed in other insulin resistance conditions such as metabolic syndrome (SM), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and obesity. However, several cases of Insulin Autoimmune Syndrome (IAS) have been reported in subjects taking ALA. The aim of the present review is to describe the main chemical and biological functions of ALA in glucose metabolism, focusing on its antioxidant activity, its role in modulating insulin sensitivity and secretion and in symptomatic peripheral diabetic polyneuropathy. We also provide a potential explanation for increased risk for the development of IAS.


## Lipoic acid and lipoic acid analogs in cancer metabolism and chemotherapy

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25284345/

The lipoic acid (lipoate) coenzyme is unique in all of mammalian metabolism. It is not only crucial to the function of some of the major enzymes feeding carbon into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, but also generates dynamic regulatory information about the metabolic status of the mitochondrial matrix, ultimately functioning to control these metabolic fluxes. Moreover, these lipoate-sensitive regulatory processes are apparently systematically redesigned in tumor cells and the affected enzymes commonly become especially central to cancer metabolism. Thus, lipoate-sensitive regulatory processes constitute potentially uniquely valuable targets for chemotherapeutic attack. Our goal here is to review the current status of our knowledge relevant to the use of lipoate and lipoate analogs to therapeutically attack malignant disease.

NB: the authors say that natural LA is not very potent while artificial LA analogs have produced promising results in phase 2 clinical trials as of 2014.



# Treatment 2: annonaceous acetogenins

## The growth-inhibitory effects of pawpaw (Asimina triloba [L.] Dunal) roots, twigs, leaves, and fruit against human gastric (AGS) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cells and their anti-inflammatory activities

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33630206/

Background: The pawpaw tree has several beneficial effects. However, no studies have been conducted to address the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of pawpaw extracts against cancer cells, and no study has investigated the anti-inflammatory effects. Hence, in this study, the growth-inhibitory effects of pawpaw (Asimina triloba [L.] Dunal) extracts against gastric (AGS) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cells and the inhibitory effects of pawpaw extracts against inflammatory factors (NO, TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS, and COX-2) were investigated.

Methods and results: The viability of AGS and HeLa cells, the analysis of cell cycle, and the expression of apoptosis marker protein were determined using MTT assay, FACS, western blotting, and TUNEL assays. The inflammatory factors were determined using Griess method, ELISA assay kit, and RAW 264.7 cells. The IC50 values of twig and unripe fruit extracts for AGS cells were 82.01 and 100.61 µg/mL, respectively. For HeLa cells, pawpaw twig extracts exhibited the strongest ability to inhibit cervical cancer cell growth (IC50 = 97.73 µg/mL). Analysis of the cell cycle phase distribution and expression of the apoptosis regulatory proteins BCL-2, BAX, caspase-3, and PARP showed that pawpaw twig, root, and unripe fruit extracts induced Sub G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of AGS and HeLa cells. In addition, the twig, root, and unripe fruit extracts of pawpaw effectively inhibited the inflammatory makers NO, TNF-α, IL-6, and iNOS. Particularly, the twig, root, and unripe fruit extracts at concentrations of 50 µg/mL exhibited > 50% inhibition of TNF-α.

Conclusions: These findings indicate that pawpaw extracts are natural therapeutic agents that may be used for the prevention and treatment of gastric and cervical cancers, and encourage further studies on the anti-inflammatory potential of the pawpaw tree.


## Correlation Between Acetogenin Content and Antiproliferative Activity of Pawpaw (Asimina triloba [L.] Dunal) Fruit Pulp Grown in Korea

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29660776/

Pawpaw (Asimina triloba [L.] Dunal) is widely cultivated in Korea for its fruit, which contains bioactive compounds, such as acetogenins. In this study, we investigated the acetogenin content and antiproliferative activity of pawpaw fruit pulp against various cancer cell lines and evaluated the relationship between these two variables at different maturation stages. Unripe fruit had higher antiproliferative activity than ripe fruit, and the activity level depended on acetogenin content. In addition, the presence of specific acetogenins was related to inhibition of certain cancer cell types. The unripe fruit methanol and ethanol extracts (URFM and URFE, respectively) that were rich in acetogenins strongly inhibited the growth of HT-1080, HeLa, and AGS cells by >50% at concentrations of less than 115 μg/mL. These findings indicate that URFM and URFE have therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer, and our study establishes a basis for further mechanistic studies of the 


## Asimin, asiminacin, and asiminecin: Novel highly cytotoxic asimicin isomers from Asimina triloba

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8027979/

Activity-directed fractionation of the stem bark extracts of the North American paw paw tree, Asimina triloba (Annonaceae), has yielded three further acetogenins: asimin (2), asiminacin (3), and asiminecin (4). 2-4 are structural isomers of asimicin (1), which is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, and thus exhibits potent antitumor and pesticidal effects. 2-4 have the same carbon skeleton and configurations as those of 1, but they have the third hydroxyl group located at C-10, C-28, and C-29, respectively, rather than at C-4. The determinations of the hydroxyl group locations were largely based on mass spectral analyses of TMSi and TMSi-d9 derivatives. 2-4 all showed highly potent cytotoxicities (ED50 values as low as < 10(-12) micrograms/mL) with notable selectivities for the HT-29 human colon cancer cell line. The presence of a third hydroxyl at C-4, C-10, C-28, or C-29, as in 1-4, greatly enhances the bioactivity of 4-deoxyasimicin (5).


## Biologically active acetogenins from stem bark of Asimina triloba

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7764028/

In continuing our research with cytotoxic and pesticidal components from the stem bark of the North American paw paw, Asimina triloba, the novel cytotoxic monotetrahydrofuran Annonaceous acetogenins, cis- and trans-annonacin-A-one, cis- and trans-gigantetrocinone and cis-isoannonacin, in addition to the known compounds, trans-isoannonacin and squamolone, have been identified. Brine shrimp lethality testing was used to direct the fractionation. The structures were elucidated by spectral analysis and/or chemical synthesis. These acetogenins have potent cytotoxicities against the human tumour cell lines of A-549 (lung carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast carcinoma) and HT-29 (colon adenocarcinoma).


## Paw paw and cancer: Annonaceous acetogenins from discovery to commercial products

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18598079/

Extracts of paw paw ( Asimina triloba, Annonaceae) are among the most potent of the 3500 species of higher plants screened for bioactive compounds in our laboratories at Purdue University. The paw paw is a small tree native to eastern North America; its edible fruits (sometimes referred to as "Indiana Bananas") have nurtured mankind for centuries. Activity-directed fractionation of the paw paw extracts, using the brine shrimp lethality bioassay, led to the isolation and molecular characterization of over 50 unique annonaceous acetogenins. Fractionation of extracts from related species resulted in the identification of over 150 additional acetogenins. The annonaceous acetogenins are derivatives of long-chain (C32 or C34) fatty acids. They are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial (complex I) as well as cytoplasmic (anaerobic) production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the related nucleotides. The powerful cytotoxicity, in vivo antitumor, pesticidal, antimalarial, anthelmintic, piscicidal, antiviral, and antimicrobial effects indicated a myriad of potentially useful applications. Commercial development of these compounds uses natural mixtures of active components, incorporated into pesticidal, topical, and dietary supplement products. Successful applications and commercial products include a shampoo, highly effective in treating infestations of head lice, fleas, and ticks; a series of pesticidal sprays, which protects host plants against a diversity of pests; and an ointment for treatment of oral herpes (HSV-1) and other skin afflictions. The extract (in capsule form) enhances a mixture of natural anthelmintics. In addition, an encapsulated extract has been effectively used by certain cancer patients as a botanical supplement product.


## Anticancer Properties of Graviola (Annona muricata): A Comprehensive Mechanistic Review

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30151067/

Graviola (Annona muricata) is a small deciduous tropical evergreen fruit tree, belonging to the Annonaceae family, and is widely grown and distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. The aerial parts of graviola have several functions: the fruits have been widely used as food confectionaries, while several preparations, especially decoctions of the bark, fruits, leaves, pericarp, seeds, and roots, have been extensively used in traditional medicine to treat multiple ailments including cancers by local communities in tropical Africa and South America. The reported therapeutic benefits of graviola against various human tumors and disease agents in in vitro culture and preclinical animal model systems are typically tested for their ability to specifically target the disease, while exerting little or no effect on normal cell viability. Over 212 phytochemical ingredients have been reported in graviola extracts prepared from different plant parts. The specific bioactive constituents responsible for the major anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and other health benefits of graviola include different classes of annonaceous acetogenins (metabolites and products of the polyketide pathway), alkaloids, flavonoids, sterols, and others. This review summarizes the current understanding of the anticancer effects of A. muricata and its constituents on diverse cancer types and disease states, as well as efficacy and safety concerns. It also includes discussion of our current understanding of possible mechanisms of action, with the hope of further stimulating the development of improved and affordable therapies for a variety of ailments.


## Acetogenin Extracted from Annona muricata Prevented the Actions of EGF in PA-1 Ovarian Cancer Cells

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32938339/

Background: In individuals with ovarian cancer, an increase in the circulating level of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) is readily apparent. Ovarian cancer cells exhibit signaling pathway of the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) and respond to the EGF. Annona muricata (AM) has been shown to decrease ovarian cell proliferation however, role of AM in regulating EGF actions is not yet to be reported.

Objective: In this study, we proposed that the fractionated compound acetogenin can inhibit the activation of EGFR-regulated signaling cascades such as MAPK7 / PI3K-Akt / mTOR / STAT upon EGF stimulation.

Methods: Ethanolic extract was prepared for the whole AM plant and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) was performed to characterize the secondary metabolites and each fraction was assessed using kedde reagent for the presence of acetogenin. The effects of acetogenins were then tested on the survival of PA-1 ovarian cancer cells under basal and EGF stimulated conditions. To delineate the role of acetogenin in EGFR signaling cascades, the in silico docking studies were conducted.

Results: The fraction of acetogenin decreased the viability of EGF induced PA-1 ovarian cancer cells that indicating the EGF inhibitory effects of acetogenin. The docking studies specifically illustrated that when the acetogenin binding with tyrosine kinase (TK) and regulatory unit (RU) which subsequently resulted in a reduction in EGF induced the survival of PA-1 ovarian cancer cells.

Discussion: The vital regulatory role of acetogenin reported in this study indicate significant anticancer activities of acetogenin from AM. The in silico study of the acetogenin function predicted that it binds specifically to Asp837 (phosphor-acceptor site) of EGFR, essential for phosphorylation of substrates in the TK domain and RU which promote downstream signaling.

Conclusion: Acetogenin isolated from AM effectively inhibited the survival of PA-1 ovarian cancer cells through impaired EGF signaling.


## Pharmacological Activities of Soursop ( Annona muricata Lin.)

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35208993/

Soursop (Annona muricata Lin.) is a plant belonging to the Annonaceae family that has been widely used globally as a traditional medicine for many diseases. In this review, we discuss the traditional use, chemical content, and pharmacological activities of A.muricata. From 49 research articles that were obtained from 1981 to 2021, A.muricata's activities were shown to include anticancer (25%), antiulcer (17%), antidiabetic (14%), antiprotozoal (10%), antidiarrhea (8%), antibacterial (8%), antiviral (8%), antihypertensive (6%), and wound healing (4%). Several biological activities and the general mechanisms underlying the effects of A.muricata have been tested both in vitro and in vivo. A.muricata contains chemicals such as acetogenins (annomuricins and annonacin), alkaloids (coreximine and reticuline), flavonoids (quercetin), and vitamins, which are predicted to be responsible for the biological activity of A.muricata.


## Emerging therapeutic potential of graviola and its constituents in cancers

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5888937/

Cancer remains a leading cause of death in the USA and around the world. Although the current synthetic inhibitors used in targeted therapies have improved patient prognosis, toxicity and development of resistance to these agents remain a challenge. Plant-derived natural products and their derivatives have historically been used to treat various diseases, including cancer. Several leading chemotherapeutic agents are directly or indirectly based on botanical natural products. Beyond these important drugs, however, a number of crude herbal or botanical preparations have also shown promising utility for cancer and other disorders. One such natural resource is derived from certain plants of the family Annonaceae, which are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions. Among the best known of these is Annona muricata, also known as soursop, graviola or guanabana. Extracts from the fruit, bark, seeds, roots and leaves of graviola, along with several other Annonaceous species, have been extensively investigated for anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Phytochemical studies have identified the acetogenins, a class of bioactive polyketide-derived constituents, from the extracts of Annonaceous species, and dozens of these compounds are present in different parts of graviola. This review summarizes current literature on the therapeutic potential and molecular mechanism of these constituents from A.muricata against cancer and many non-malignant diseases. Based on available data, there is good evidence that these long-used plants could have both chemopreventive and therapeutic potential. Appropriate attention to safety studies will be important to assess their effectiveness on various diseases caused or promoted by inflammation.


## Cryo-electron microscopy reveals how acetogenins inhibit mitochondrial respiratory complex I

Mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), a crucial enzyme in energy metabolism, captures the redox potential energy from NADH oxidation/ubiquinone reduction to create the proton motive force used to drive ATP synthesis in oxidative phosphorylation. High-resolution single-particle electron cryo-EM analyses have provided detailed structural knowledge of the catalytic machinery of complex I, but not of the molecular principles of its energy transduction mechanism. Although ubiquinone is considered to bind in a long channel at the interface of the membrane-embedded and hydrophilic domains, with channel residues likely involved in coupling substrate reduction to proton translocation, no structures with the channel fully occupied have yet been described. Here, we report the structure (determined by cryo-EM) of mouse complex I with a tight-binding natural product acetogenin inhibitor, which resembles the native substrate, bound along the full length of the expected ubiquinone-binding channel. Our structure reveals the mode of acetogenin binding and the molecular basis for structure-activity relationships within the acetogenin family. It also shows that acetogenins are such potent inhibitors because they are highly hydrophobic molecules that contain two specific hydrophilic moieties spaced to lock into two hydrophilic regions of the otherwise hydrophobic channel. The central hydrophilic section of the channel does not favor binding of the isoprenoid chain when the native substrate is fully bound but stabilizes the ubiquinone/ubiquinol headgroup as it transits to/from the active site. Therefore, the amphipathic nature of the channel supports both tight binding of the amphipathic inhibitor and rapid exchange of the ubiquinone/ubiquinol substrate and product.


## Antimutagenic and antitumor activities of a water-soluble fraction of soursop (syn Graviola, Annona muricata L.) fruit pulp

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38285000/

Soursop (Annona muricata) is a tropical tree whose decoction derived from bark, root, seed, or leaf has been used for medicinal uses. In addition, the fruit itself is considered a food, and the juice is utilized to treat heart and liver diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the phenolic content. In addition, a water-soluble fraction of the soursop fruit pulp (WSSP) was examined for the following properties: antioxidant, mutagenic, and antimutagenicity. UV-visible spectrophotometry determined total phenolic content by the Folin-Ciocalteu method to be 11.22 ± 0.6 mg of gallic acid equivalent per gram dried extract, and free-radical scavenging activity by the 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH•) showed an EC50 of 1032 µg/ml. In the Salmonella/microsome assay, no marked mutagenicity was induced following WSSP treatment, and a chemopreventive capacity was observed in the antimutagenic assay. The cytotoxicity assays were carried out using the water-soluble tetrazolium salt and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays demonstrated that WSSP induced significant cytotoxicity in MCF-7 and Caco-2 cells, indicating greater effectiveness of cytotoxic action by destroying cell membrane integrity. Data suggest that WSSP may exert beneficial effects as a DNA chemopreventive and antitumor agent.


## Anti-cancer effect of Annona Muricata Linn Leaves Crude Extract (AMCE) on breast cancer cell line

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27558166/

Annona muricata Linn which comes from Annonaceae family possesses many therapeutic benefits as reported in previous studies and to no surprise, it has been used in many cultures to treat various ailments including headaches, insomnia, and rheumatism to even treating cancer. However, Annona muricata Linn obtained from different cultivation area does not necessarily offer the same therapeutic effects towards breast cancer (in regards to its bioactive compound production). In this study, anti-proliferative and anti-cancer effects of Annona muricata crude extract (AMCE) on breast cancer cell lines were evaluated.MethodsA screening of nineteen samples of Annona muricata from different location was determined by MTT assay on breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and 4 T1) which revealed a varied potency (IC50) amongst them. Then, based on the IC50 profile from the anti-proliferative assay, further downward assays such as cell cycle analysis, Annexin V/FITC, AO/PI, migration, invasion, and wound healing assay were performed only with the most potent leaf aqueous extract (B1 AMCE) on 4 T1 breast cancer cell line to investigate its anti-cancer effect. Then, the in vivo anti-cancer study was conducted where mice were fed with extract after inducing the tumor. At the end of the experiment, histopathology of tumor section, tumor nitric oxide level, tumor malondialdehyde level, clonogenic assay, T cell immunophenotyping, and proteome profiler analysis were performed.ResultsAnnona muricata crude extract samples exhibited different level of cytotoxicity toward breast cancer cell lines. The selected B1 AMCE reduced the tumor’s size and weight, showed anti-metastatic features, and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo of the 4 T1 cells. Furthermore, it decreased the level of nitric oxide and malondialdehyde in tumor while also increased the level of white blood cell, T-cell, and natural killer cell population.ConclusionThe results suggest that, B1 AMCE is a promising candidate for cancer treatment especially in breast cancer and deserves further research as an alternative to conventional drugs while also stressed out the selection of soursop sample which plays a significant role in determining its potential therapeutic effect on cancer.


## Photothermal combined with intratumoral injection of annonaceous acetogenin nanoparticles for breast cancer therapy

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35219964/

ACGs (annonaceous acetogenins) possess excellent antitumor activity, but their serious accompanying toxicity has prevented their application in the clinic. To address this problem, we therefore constructed an intratumoral drug delivery system integrating chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. The PEGylation of polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA-PEG NPs) possessed an excellent biocompatibility with size of 70.96 ± 2.55 nm, thus can be used as good photothermal materials in the body. Moreover, PDA-PEG NPs can kill half of cancer cells under NIR (near-infrared) laser irradiation, and the survival rate of 4T1 cells is only 1% when ACG NPs and PDA-PEG NPs are combined. In vivo distribution studies showed that the 0.1 mg/kg ACGs NPs + PDA-PEG NPs + NIR group had the highest tumor inhibition rate, which was significantly superior to that of the 0.1 mg/kg ACGs NPs intratumoral injection group (82.65% vs. 59.08%). Altogether, the combination of PDA-PEG NPs + NIR with chemotherapy drugs may provide a feasible and effective strategy for the treatment of superficial tumors.


## A Review on Annona muricata and Its Anticancer Activity

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36139697/

The ongoing rise in the number of cancer cases raises concerns regarding the efficacy of the various treatment methods that are currently available. Consequently, patients are looking for alternatives to traditional cancer treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy as a replacement. Medicinal plants are universally acknowledged as the cornerstone of preventative medicine and therapeutic practices. Annona muricata is a member of the family Annonaceae and is familiar for its medicinal properties. A. muricata has been identified to have promising compounds that could potentially be utilized for the treatment of cancer. The most prevalent phytochemical components identified and isolated from this plant are alkaloids, phenols, and acetogenins. This review focuses on the role of A. muricata extract against various types of cancer, modulation of cellular proliferation and necrosis, and bioactive metabolites responsible for various pharmacological activities along with their ethnomedicinal uses. Additionally, this review highlights the molecular mechanism of the role of A. muricata extract in downregulating anti-apoptotic and several genes involved in the pro-cancer metabolic pathways and decreasing the expression of proteins involved in cell invasion and metastasis while upregulating proapoptotic genes and genes involved in the destruction of cancer cells. Therefore, the active phytochemicals identified in A. muricata have the potential to be employed as a promising anti-cancer agent.

## The Warburg Trap

A Novel Therapeutic Approach for Targeting Osteosarcoma

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38201265/

Although urgently needed, no significant improvements in osteosarcoma (OS) therapy have been achieved within the last decades. Here, we present a new therapeutic approach based on drug combinations consisting of mitochondrial complex I (MCI) inhibitors and ionophores that induce cancer cell-specific cell death based on a modulation of cellular energy metabolism and intracellular pH (pHi) named the Warburg Trap (WT). The effects of several drug combinations on intracellular pH, cell viability, colony-forming capacity and expression of WNT-target genes were analysed using OS cell lines and primary human osteoblasts (HOB). Tumour take rates and tumour volumes were analysed in vivo using a chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM). Several WT drug combinations induced the intracellular acidification and apoptotic cell death in OS cells, whereas HOBs tolerated the treatment. A significant inhibition of the colony-forming ability of OS cells and downregulation of WNT-target genes suggest that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are also targeted by the WT approach. In vivo, we observed a significant reduction in the tumour take rates in response to WT drug treatment. Our data suggest that the Warburg Trap is a promising approach for the development of a novel and effective OS therapy to replace or supplement the current OS chemotherapy.

## An evaluation of the quality of Annona muricata leaf products

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37440207/

Objectives: Annona muricata, also known as graviola, is traditionally used for the treatment of a range of disorders including cancer. Interest in A. muricata use has increased in recent years. This study investigated the quality and safety of a selection of commercially available A. muricata leaf products.

Methods: Seven commercially available products were purchased via online shopping sites. Each product was assessed for quality indicators including weight variation, quantification of the bioactive constituent annonacin, presence of annonaceous acetogenins and contaminants. The samples were evaluated by thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, low-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Microbial analysis was carried out in accordance with the British Pharmacopoeia. Heavy metals were analysed by inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry.

Key findings: Of the seven products analysed, one product contained less than half of the content stated on the label. The labelled dosage recommendation varied between products. There was a high variation in annonacin concentration (1.05-3.09 mg/g) and the presence of annonaceous acetogenins. One of the products was found to have a total aerobic microbial count above the United States Pharmacopoeia limit.

Conclusions: The variation in the indicators of quality and safety of commercially available A. muricata leaf products tested have implications for clinicians and people living with cancer who use these herbal products.


# Chlorine dioxide

## The Anticancer Potential of Chlorine Dioxide in Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9636887/

Background

Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is an effective disinfectant consisting of oxygen, chloride, and potassium. Because of its high oxidative capacity, ClO2 exerts antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal effects. However, its anticancer effects remain to be elucidated.

Methodology

The anticancer activity of CIO2 was assessed on DMS114 small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as control by WST-1, Annexin V, cell cycle analysis, and acridine orange staining. We for the first time investigated the possible therapeutic effects of long-term stabilized ClO2 solution (LTSCD).

Results

Our preliminary findings showed that LTSCD significantly inhibited the proliferation of SCLC cells (p < 0.01) with less toxicity in HUVEC cells. Additionally, LTSCD induced apoptotic cell death in SCLC cells through nuclear blebbing and vacuolar formation. However, LTSCD treatment did not induce cell cycle arrest in both cell lines.

Conclusions

LTSCD can be a therapeutic potential for the treatment of SCLC. However, further investigations are required to assess the LTSCD-induced cell death in SCLC both in vitro and in vivo.

## Chlorine dioxide as a possible adjunct to metabolic treatment

https://www.cancertreatmentjournal.com/articles/chlorine-dioxide-as-a-possible-adjunct-to-metabolic-treatment.html

A first patient with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas has decided, on his own, to refuse chemotherapy but to treat himself with lipoïc acid, hydroxycitrate combined with oral ingestion of chlorine dioxide. His blood tests and radiological examinations have almost normalized and the disease is stable at 18 months. Another patient with hormone resistant metastatic prostate cancer has experienced a sharp drop in PSA level as well as improved medical condition. From extensive literature review, the mechanism of action of chlorine dioxide is unknown. It is our hypothesis (albeit unproven) that chlorine dioxide results in tumor cell acidification of the alkaline pH of cancer cells.
