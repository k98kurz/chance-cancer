## Abstract

It is a longstanding debate whether cancer is one disease or a set of very diverse diseases. The goal of this paper is to suggest strongly that most of (if not all) the hallmarks of cancer could be the consequence of the Warburg's effect. As a result of the metabolic impairment of the oxidative phosphorylation, there is a decrease in ATP concentration. To compensate the reduced energy yield, there is massive glucose uptake, anaerobic glycolysis, with an up-regulation of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway resulting in increased biosynthesis leading to increased cell division and local pressure. This increased pressure is responsible for the fractal shape of the tumor, the secretion of collagen by the fibroblasts and plays a critical role in metastatic spread. The massive extrusion of lactic acid contributes to the extracellular acidity and the activation of the immune system. The decreased oxidative phosphorylation leads to impairment in CO2 levels inside and outside the cell, with increased intracellular alkalosis and contribution of carbonic acid to extracellular acidosis-mediated by at least two cancer-associated carbonic anhydrase isoforms. The increased intracellular alkalosis is a strong mitogenic signal, which bypasses most inhibitory signals. Mitochondrial disappearance (such as seen in very aggressive tumors) is a consequence of mitochondrial swelling, itself a result of decreased ATP concentration. The transmembrane pumps, which extrude, from the mitochondria, ions, and water, are ATP-dependant. Therapy aiming at increasing both the number and the efficacy of mitochondria could be very useful.

## Out of Warburg effect

An effective cancer treatment targeting the tumor specific metabolism and dysregulated pH

### Abstract

As stated by Otto Warburg nearly a century ago, cancer is a metabolic disease, a fermentation caused by malfunctioning mitochondria, resulting in increased anabolism and decreased catabolism. Treatment should, therefore, aim at restoring the energy yield. To decrease anabolism, glucose uptake should be reduced (ketogenic diet). To increase catabolism, the oxidative phosphorylation should be restored. Treatment with a combination of α-lipoic acid and hydroxycitrate has been shown to be effective in multiple animal models. This treatment, in combination with conventional chemotherapy, has yielded extremely encouraging results in glioblastoma, brain metastasis and lung cancer. Randomized trials are necessary to confirm these preliminary data. The major limitation is the fact that the combination of α-lipoic acid and hydroxycitrate can only be effective if the mitochondria are still present and/or functional. That may not be the case in the most aggressive tumors. The increased intracellular alkalosis is a strong mitogenic signal, which bypasses most inhibitory signals. Concomitant correction of this alkalosis may be a very effective treatment in case of mitochondrial failure.


## α-Lipoic acid inhibits human lung cancer cell proliferation through Grb2-mediated EGFR downregulation

### Link

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28993193/

### Abstract

Results: α -LA dramatically decreased NSCLC cell proliferation by downregulating Grb2; in contrast, Grb2 overexpression significantly prevented α-LA-induced decrease in cell growth in vitro. Western blot analysis indicated that α-LA decreased the levels of phospho-EGFR, CDK2/4/6, Cyclins D3 and E1, which are associated with the inhibition of G1/S-phase transition. Additional experiments indicated that Grb2 inhibition partially abolished EGF-induced phospho-EGFR and phospho-ERK1/2 activity. In addition, α-LA exerted greater inhibitory effects than gefitinib on NSCLC cells by preventing EGF-induced EGFR activation.

Conclusion: For the first time, these findings provide the first evidence that α-LA inhibits cell proliferation through Grb2 by suppressing EGFR phosphorylation and that MAPK/ERK is involved in this pathway.

## α-Lipoic Acid Targeting PDK1/NRF2 Axis Contributes to the Apoptosis Effect of Lung Cancer Cells

### Link

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34211631/

### Abstract

As an antioxidant, α-lipoic acid (LA) has attracted much attention to cancer research. However, the exact mechanism of LA in cancer progression control and prevention remains to be unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that α-lipoic acid has inhibitory effects on the proliferation, migration, and proapoptotic effects of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines A549 and PC9. LA-induced NSCLC cell apoptosis was mediated by elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Further study confirmed that it is by downregulating the expression of PDK1 (the PDH kinase), resulted in less phospho-PDH phenotype which could interact with Keap1, the negative controller of NRF2, directly leading to NRF2 decrease. Thus, by downregulating the NRF2 antioxidant system, LA plays a role in promoting apoptosis through the ROS signaling pathway. Moreover, LA could enhance other PDK inhibitors with the proapoptosis effect. In summary, our study shows that LA promotes apoptosis and exerts its antitumor activity against lung cancer by regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism enzyme-related antioxidative stress system. Administration of LA to the tumor-bearing animal model further supported the antitumor effect of LA. These findings provided new ideas for the clinical application of LA in the field of cancer therapy.

### Animal model: 2.5. LA Inhibits Lung Carcinoma via Reducing PDK1 and NRF2 Expression In Vivo

To further demonstrate the anticancer effects of LA in vivo and the inhibition of NRF2 and PDK1, a tumor-bearing mouse (C57BL/6, black) model was constructed. Compared to the control group, intraperitoneal administration of LA (91 mg/kg) could significantly decrease the size (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)) and weight (Figure 5(c)) of the tumors formed by LLC cells (mouse lung cancer cells). In addition, the mice were tolerant to LA at the concentration used (Figure 5(d)).


## A combination of alpha lipoic acid and calcium hydroxycitrate is efficient against mouse cancer models: preliminary results

### Link

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20372858/

### Abstract

The impact of metabolic dysregulation on tumor development has long been established. We have targeted two enzymes that are altered during carcinogenesis: pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which is down-regulated, and ATP citrate lyase, which is overexpressed in cancer cells. Alpha lipoic acid is a cofactor of PDH, while hydroxycitrate is a known inhibitor of ATP citrate lyase. Our hypothesis is that a combination of these drugs may have antitumoral potential. The efficacy of these molecules was screened in vitro by treatment of different human cancer and murine cell lines. Lipoic acid reduced the cell number by 10-50% depending on concentrations (0.1-10 microM) and cell types. Calcium hydroxycitrate reduced the cell number by 5-60% at different concentrations (10-500 microM). When hydroxycitrate and lipoic acid were used together, there was a major cytotoxic effect: complete cell death was seen following 8 microM lipoic acid and 300 microM hydroxycitrate treatment for 72 h. The combination of alpha lipoic acid and hydroxycitrate was administered to healthy mice, at doses currently utilized for other indications than cancer; no demonstrable toxicity was observed. The combination was used to treat mouse syngenic cancer models: MBT-2 bladder transitional cell carcinoma, B16-F10 melanoma and LL/2 Lewis lung carcinoma. The efficacy of this combination appears similar to conventional chemotherapy (cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil) as it resulted in significant tumor growth retardation and enhanced survival. This preliminary study suggests that this combination of drugs is efficient against cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. A clinical trial is warranted.


## Tumor regression with a combination of drugs interfering with the tumor metabolism: efficacy of hydroxycitrate, lipoic acid and capsaicin

### Link

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22797854/

### Abstract

Cellular metabolic alterations are now well described as implicated in cancer and some strategies are currently developed to target these different pathways. In previous papers, we demonstrated that a combination of molecules (namely alpha-lipoic acid and hydroxycitrate, i.e. Metabloc™) targeting the cancer metabolism markedly decreased tumor cell growth in mice. In this work, we demonstrate that the addition of capsaicin further delays tumor growth in mice in a dose dependant manner. This is true for the three animal model tested: lung (LLC) cancer, bladder cancer (MBT-2) and melanoma B16F10. There was no apparent side effect of this ternary combination. The addition of a fourth drug (octreotide) is even more effective resulting in tumor regression in mice bearing LLC cancer. These four compounds are all known to target the cellular metabolism not its DNA. The efficacy, the apparent lack of toxicity, the long clinical track records of these medications in human medicine, all points toward the need for a clinical trial. The dramatic efficacy of treatment suggests that cancer may simply be a disease of dysregulated cellular metabolism.

# Treatment 2: annonaceous acetogenins

## The growth-inhibitory effects of pawpaw (Asimina triloba [L.] Dunal) roots, twigs, leaves, and fruit against human gastric (AGS) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cells and their anti-inflammatory activities

### Link

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33630206/

### Abstract

Background: The pawpaw tree has several beneficial effects. However, no studies have been conducted to address the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of pawpaw extracts against cancer cells, and no study has investigated the anti-inflammatory effects. Hence, in this study, the growth-inhibitory effects of pawpaw (Asimina triloba [L.] Dunal) extracts against gastric (AGS) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cells and the inhibitory effects of pawpaw extracts against inflammatory factors (NO, TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS, and COX-2) were investigated.

Methods and results: The viability of AGS and HeLa cells, the analysis of cell cycle, and the expression of apoptosis marker protein were determined using MTT assay, FACS, western blotting, and TUNEL assays. The inflammatory factors were determined using Griess method, ELISA assay kit, and RAW 264.7 cells. The IC50 values of twig and unripe fruit extracts for AGS cells were 82.01 and 100.61 µg/mL, respectively. For HeLa cells, pawpaw twig extracts exhibited the strongest ability to inhibit cervical cancer cell growth (IC50 = 97.73 µg/mL). Analysis of the cell cycle phase distribution and expression of the apoptosis regulatory proteins BCL-2, BAX, caspase-3, and PARP showed that pawpaw twig, root, and unripe fruit extracts induced Sub G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of AGS and HeLa cells. In addition, the twig, root, and unripe fruit extracts of pawpaw effectively inhibited the inflammatory makers NO, TNF-α, IL-6, and iNOS. Particularly, the twig, root, and unripe fruit extracts at concentrations of 50 µg/mL exhibited > 50% inhibition of TNF-α.

Conclusions: These findings indicate that pawpaw extracts are natural therapeutic agents that may be used for the prevention and treatment of gastric and cervical cancers, and encourage further studies on the anti-inflammatory potential of the pawpaw tree.


## Correlation Between Acetogenin Content and Antiproliferative Activity of Pawpaw (Asimina triloba [L.] Dunal) Fruit Pulp Grown in Korea

### Link

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29660776/

### Abstract

Pawpaw (Asimina triloba [L.] Dunal) is widely cultivated in Korea for its fruit, which contains bioactive compounds, such as acetogenins. In this study, we investigated the acetogenin content and antiproliferative activity of pawpaw fruit pulp against various cancer cell lines and evaluated the relationship between these two variables at different maturation stages. Unripe fruit had higher antiproliferative activity than ripe fruit, and the activity level depended on acetogenin content. In addition, the presence of specific acetogenins was related to inhibition of certain cancer cell types. The unripe fruit methanol and ethanol extracts (URFM and URFE, respectively) that were rich in acetogenins strongly inhibited the growth of HT-1080, HeLa, and AGS cells by >50% at concentrations of less than 115 μg/mL. These findings indicate that URFM and URFE have therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer, and our study establishes a basis for further mechanistic studies of the 


## Asimin, asiminacin, and asiminecin

Novel highly cytotoxic asimicin isomers from Asimina triloba

### Link

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8027979/

### Abstract

Activity-directed fractionation of the stem bark extracts of the North American paw paw tree, Asimina triloba (Annonaceae), has yielded three further acetogenins: asimin (2), asiminacin (3), and asiminecin (4). 2-4 are structural isomers of asimicin (1), which is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, and thus exhibits potent antitumor and pesticidal effects. 2-4 have the same carbon skeleton and configurations as those of 1, but they have the third hydroxyl group located at C-10, C-28, and C-29, respectively, rather than at C-4. The determinations of the hydroxyl group locations were largely based on mass spectral analyses of TMSi and TMSi-d9 derivatives. 2-4 all showed highly potent cytotoxicities (ED50 values as low as < 10(-12) micrograms/mL) with notable selectivities for the HT-29 human colon cancer cell line. The presence of a third hydroxyl at C-4, C-10, C-28, or C-29, as in 1-4, greatly enhances the bioactivity of 4-deoxyasimicin (5).

Annonaceous acetogenins from discovery to commercial products

### Link

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18598079/

### Abstract

Extracts of paw paw ( Asimina triloba, Annonaceae) are among the most potent of the 3500 species of higher plants screened for bioactive compounds in our laboratories at Purdue University. The paw paw is a small tree native to eastern North America; its edible fruits (sometimes referred to as "Indiana Bananas") have nurtured mankind for centuries. Activity-directed fractionation of the paw paw extracts, using the brine shrimp lethality bioassay, led to the isolation and molecular characterization of over 50 unique annonaceous acetogenins. Fractionation of extracts from related species resulted in the identification of over 150 additional acetogenins. The annonaceous acetogenins are derivatives of long-chain (C32 or C34) fatty acids. They are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial (complex I) as well as cytoplasmic (anaerobic) production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the related nucleotides. The powerful cytotoxicity, in vivo antitumor, pesticidal, antimalarial, anthelmintic, piscicidal, antiviral, and antimicrobial effects indicated a myriad of potentially useful applications. Commercial development of these compounds uses natural mixtures of active components, incorporated into pesticidal, topical, and dietary supplement products. Successful applications and commercial products include a shampoo, highly effective in treating infestations of head lice, fleas, and ticks; a series of pesticidal sprays, which protects host plants against a diversity of pests; and an ointment for treatment of oral herpes (HSV-1) and other skin afflictions. The extract (in capsule form) enhances a mixture of natural anthelmintics. In addition, an encapsulated extract has been effectively used by certain cancer patients as a botanical supplement product.


## Anticancer Properties of Graviola ( Annona muricata): A Comprehensive Mechanistic Review

### Link

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30151067/

### Abstract

Graviola (Annona muricata) is a small deciduous tropical evergreen fruit tree, belonging to the Annonaceae family, and is widely grown and distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. The aerial parts of graviola have several functions: the fruits have been widely used as food confectionaries, while several preparations, especially decoctions of the bark, fruits, leaves, pericarp, seeds, and roots, have been extensively used in traditional medicine to treat multiple ailments including cancers by local communities in tropical Africa and South America. The reported therapeutic benefits of graviola against various human tumors and disease agents in in vitro culture and preclinical animal model systems are typically tested for their ability to specifically target the disease, while exerting little or no effect on normal cell viability. Over 212 phytochemical ingredients have been reported in graviola extracts prepared from different plant parts. The specific bioactive constituents responsible for the major anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and other health benefits of graviola include different classes of annonaceous acetogenins (metabolites and products of the polyketide pathway), alkaloids, flavonoids, sterols, and others. This review summarizes the current understanding of the anticancer effects of A. muricata and its constituents on diverse cancer types and disease states, as well as efficacy and safety concerns. It also includes discussion of our current understanding of possible mechanisms of action, with the hope of further stimulating the development of improved and affordable therapies for a variety of ailments.

## Emerging therapeutic potential of graviola and its constituents in cancers

### Abstract

Cancer remains a leading cause of death in the USA and around the world. Although the current synthetic inhibitors used in targeted therapies have improved patient prognosis, toxicity and development of resistance to these agents remain a challenge. Plant-derived natural products and their derivatives have historically been used to treat various diseases, including cancer. Several leading chemotherapeutic agents are directly or indirectly based on botanical natural products. Beyond these important drugs, however, a number of crude herbal or botanical preparations have also shown promising utility for cancer and other disorders. One such natural resource is derived from certain plants of the family Annonaceae, which are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions. Among the best known of these is Annona muricata, also known as soursop, graviola or guanabana. Extracts from the fruit, bark, seeds, roots and leaves of graviola, along with several other Annonaceous species, have been extensively investigated for anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Phytochemical studies have identified the acetogenins, a class of bioactive polyketide-derived constituents, from the extracts of Annonaceous species, and dozens of these compounds are present in different parts of graviola. This review summarizes current literature on the therapeutic potential and molecular mechanism of these constituents from A.muricata against cancer and many non-malignant diseases. Based on available data, there is good evidence that these long-used plants could have both chemopreventive and therapeutic potential. Appropriate attention to safety studies will be important to assess their effectiveness on various diseases caused or promoted by inflammation.

A Novel Therapeutic Approach for Targeting Osteosarcoma

### Link

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38201265/

### Abstract

Although urgently needed, no significant improvements in osteosarcoma (OS) therapy have been achieved within the last decades. Here, we present a new therapeutic approach based on drug combinations consisting of mitochondrial complex I (MCI) inhibitors and ionophores that induce cancer cell-specific cell death based on a modulation of cellular energy metabolism and intracellular pH (pHi) named the Warburg Trap (WT). The effects of several drug combinations on intracellular pH, cell viability, colony-forming capacity and expression of WNT-target genes were analysed using OS cell lines and primary human osteoblasts (HOB). Tumour take rates and tumour volumes were analysed in vivo using a chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM). Several WT drug combinations induced the intracellular acidification and apoptotic cell death in OS cells, whereas HOBs tolerated the treatment. A significant inhibition of the colony-forming ability of OS cells and downregulation of WNT-target genes suggest that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are also targeted by the WT approach. In vivo, we observed a significant reduction in the tumour take rates in response to WT drug treatment. Our data suggest that the Warburg Trap is a promising approach for the development of a novel and effective OS therapy to replace or supplement the current OS chemotherapy.


## An evaluation of the quality of Annona muricata leaf products

### Link

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37440207/

### Abstract

Objectives: Annona muricata, also known as graviola, is traditionally used for the treatment of a range of disorders including cancer. Interest in A. muricata use has increased in recent years. This study investigated the quality and safety of a selection of commercially available A. muricata leaf products.

Methods: Seven commercially available products were purchased via online shopping sites. Each product was assessed for quality indicators including weight variation, quantification of the bioactive constituent annonacin, presence of annonaceous acetogenins and contaminants. The samples were evaluated by thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, low-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Microbial analysis was carried out in accordance with the British Pharmacopoeia. Heavy metals were analysed by inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry.

Key findings: Of the seven products analysed, one product contained less than half of the content stated on the label. The labelled dosage recommendation varied between products. There was a high variation in annonacin concentration (1.05-3.09 mg/g) and the presence of annonaceous acetogenins. One of the products was found to have a total aerobic microbial count above the United States Pharmacopoeia limit.

Conclusions: The variation in the indicators of quality and safety of commercially available A. muricata leaf products tested have implications for clinicians and people living with cancer who use these herbal products.

## The Anticancer Potential of Chlorine Dioxide in Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells

### Link

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9636887/

### Abstract

Background

Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is an effective disinfectant consisting of oxygen, chloride, and potassium. Because of its high oxidative capacity, ClO2 exerts antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal effects. However, its anticancer effects remain to be elucidated.

Methodology

The anticancer activity of CIO2 was assessed on DMS114 small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as control by WST-1, Annexin V, cell cycle analysis, and acridine orange staining. We for the first time investigated the possible therapeutic effects of long-term stabilized ClO2 solution (LTSCD).

Results

Our preliminary findings showed that LTSCD significantly inhibited the proliferation of SCLC cells (p < 0.01) with less toxicity in HUVEC cells. Additionally, LTSCD induced apoptotic cell death in SCLC cells through nuclear blebbing and vacuolar formation. However, LTSCD treatment did not induce cell cycle arrest in both cell lines.

Conclusions

LTSCD can be a therapeutic potential for the treatment of SCLC. However, further investigations are required to assess the LTSCD-induced cell death in SCLC both in vitro and in vivo.

## Chlorine dioxide as a possible adjunct to metabolic treatment

https://www.cancertreatmentjournal.com/articles/chlorine-dioxide-as-a-possible-adjunct-to-metabolic-treatment.html

### Abstract

A first patient with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas has decided, on his own, to refuse chemotherapy but to treat himself with lipoïc acid, hydroxycitrate combined with oral ingestion of chlorine dioxide. His blood tests and radiological examinations have almost normalized and the disease is stable at 18 months. Another patient with hormone resistant metastatic prostate cancer has experienced a sharp drop in PSA level as well as improved medical condition. From extensive literature review, the mechanism of action of chlorine dioxide is unknown. It is our hypothesis (albeit unproven) that chlorine dioxide results in tumor cell acidification of the alkaline pH of cancer cells.
