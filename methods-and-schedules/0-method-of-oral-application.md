# Measurement method

Note that all substances will be a powdered form. Anything too coarse will
be ground with a clean mortar and pestle to reach the right consistency.

Scale will be calibrated before measuring an amount but not between
measurements of that amount unless the scale has been perturbed.

## For amounts at or above 10 mg

1. Add an amount to the measuring tray.
2. Close the lid to prevent influence from air currents.
3. Read the measurement.
4. Add or remove from the measuring tray as appropriate.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the amount is consistently measured to be the
target value.

## For amounts below 10 mg

Due to the precision limitations of the scale used, small amounts will
require a more careful measurement protocol.

1. Measure some number of mg of the substance (the solute) that is a sum of intended dose greater than 10mg.
2. Transfer the amount measured to a plastic cup.
3. Select solvent: water for Annona muricata; Everclear for ALA.
4. Measure some number of mL that is sufficient to dissolve the solute and be easily meted out in doses.
5. Thoroughly mix to dissolve.
6. Measure out a proportion of solution equal to the intended dose divided by the total solute.
