# Measurement method

Note that all substances will be a powdered form. Anything too coarse will
be ground with a clean mortar and pestle to reach the right consistency.

Scale will be calibrated before measuring an amount but not between
measurements of that amount unless the scale has been perturbed.

## For amounts at or above 10 mg

1. Add an amount to the measuring tray.
2. Close the lid to prevent influence from air currents.
3. Read the measurement.
4. Add or remove from the measuring tray as appropriate.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the amount is consistently measured to be the
target value.

## For amounts below 10 mg

Due to the precision limitations of the scale used, small amounts will
require a more careful measurement protocol.

1. Measure 2^n mg, where 2 < n.
2. Transfer the amount measured to a flat, clean surface.
3. Carefully divide the amount in half.
4. Repeat step 3 with each amount until equal amounts of approximately the
correct mass are achieved.
5. If the correct mass cannot be achieved by division, divide to the highest
multiple of 2 mg below the target, then add smaller amounts achieved through
division according to steps 1-4.
