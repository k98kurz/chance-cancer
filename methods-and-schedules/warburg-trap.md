# Overview

Warburg Trap is a mixture of mitochondrial complex I inhibitors and H+
ionophores. Metformin itself is effective in reducing cell viability in
cancer cells exhibiting the Warburg effect at high doses, but the required
dose decreases by 2-3 orders of magnitude when combined with the ionophore
Monensin and the fibrate Fenofibrate.

Metformin is not toxic to cats but has the side effects of reduced appetite
and vomitting. See
[here](https://www.vin.com/apputil/Project/DefaultAdv1.aspx?pId=99&id=2991478)
for a study about using metformin in cats for diabetes. It was not an
effective treatment for cat diabetes, so its mitochondrial effects may be
different in felines.

Monensin is known to be deadly toxic to horses fed a dose appropriate for
cows or other ruminants. It may not be appropriate for cats.
