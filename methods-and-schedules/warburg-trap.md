# Overview

Warburg Trap is a mixture of mitochondrial complex I inhibitors and H+
ionophores. Metformin itself is effective in reducing cell viability in
cancer cells exhibiting the Warburg effect at high doses, but the required
dose decreases by 2-3 orders of magnitude when combined with the ionophore
Monensin and the fibrate Fenofibrate.

See the paper [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38201265/).

Metformin is not toxic to cats but has the side effects of reduced appetite
and vomitting. See
[here](https://www.vin.com/apputil/Project/DefaultAdv1.aspx?pId=99&id=2991478)
for a study about using metformin in cats for diabetes. It was not an
effective treatment for cat diabetes, so its mitochondrial effects may be
different in felines. Doses over 25 mg/day were associated with appetite loss,
weight loss, and vomiting.

Monensin is known to be deadly toxic to horses fed a dose appropriate for
cows or other ruminants. One study from 1982 found that a 0.02% concentration
in dry food was effective against Toxoplasma oocyst shedding in cats, and the
[abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7131189/) indicates the formula is
well tolerated in cats.

Fenofibrate has been used in cats to treat hypertriglyceridemia. Median dose
was 5 mg/kg bodyweight (range 3.2-6; q24h PO). Only one of the 17 adult cats
had an adverse reaction (diarrhea). The study may have demonstrated mean
reversion for the disease since there was no control group, but the relevant
information is the demonstrated tolerance at the 5 mg/kg-bw dose. The full text
is available [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10812274/).

# Dosing schedule

Based upon an estimated blood volume of 300 mL, concentrations from the paper,
and the molecular masses from biomol, the following doses are calculated:

| Chemical      | Volume | Concentration | Molar Mass  | Dose  |
|---------------|--------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Metformin HCl | 0.3 L  | 1 mM          | 165.6 g/mol | 50 mg |
| Monensin      | 0.3 L  | 5 nM          | 692.9 g/mol | 1 ug  |
| Fenofibrate   | 0.3 L  | 10 uM         | 360.8 g/mol | 1 mg  |

Based upon an estimate that 60% of a cat's body mass is water, and since Chance
is about 5kg, the following doses are calculated:

| Chemical      | Volume | Concentration | Molar Mass  | Dose   |
|---------------|--------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Metformin HCl | 3 L    | 1 mM          | 165.6 g/mol | 500 mg |
| Monensin      | 3 L    | 5 nM          | 692.9 g/mol | 10 ug  |
| Fenofibrate   | 3 L    | 10 uM         | 360.8 g/mol | 11 mg  |


Obviously, measuring weights in micrograms is infeasible. With various
absorption/bioavailability percentages and a goal of simply reaching the
therapeutic level once per day we get the following:

| Chemical    | Dose   | 5%     | 10%    | 20%    | 50%   |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Metformin   | 500 mg | 10 g   | 5 g   | 2.5 g  | 1 g   |
| Monensin    | 10 ug  | 200 ug | 100 ug | 50 ug  | 20 ug |
| Fenofibrate | 11 mg  | 220 mg | 110 mg | 55 mg  | 22 mg |

Assuming a 4-hour biological half-life, after 24 hours, only 1.5% of the
original dose will be bioavailable; with a 2-hour biological half-life,
only 0.02% will be bioavailable after 24 hours. In either case, concentration
build-up will not be an issue. With a 6-hour biological half-life, 6.25% will
remain after 24 hours on the first day, and this concentration asymptotically
approaches 1/15 (~6.67%) as treatment continues. With a 12-hour biological
half-life, 25% remains bioavailable after the first day, and the concentration
asymptotically approaches 1/3 (~33.3%) as treatment continues. With a 24-hour
biological half-life, 50% will remain after the first day, and the concentration
at the end of each 24-hour treatment period asymptotically approaches 100% as
treatment continues. I could not find the pharmikodynamics of these chemicals
for cats.

However, the cancer is already quite advanced and aggressive, so this treatment
plan will also be somewhat aggressive, assuming a 20% bioavailability for
fenofibrate and 10% for monensin. Going to try to feed up to 40mg metformin per
day; more than this will require reducing the G.c.+ALA+A.m. dose level.

The following are constructed to increase the dose until therapeutic effects are
achieved or side effects encountered.

Each stage except the last will be for one day. The final dose will be
maintained until the cancer is gone or the treatment fails. Doses will be
increased further if positive effects are not noted after one week.

## Metformin

- Phase 1: 10 mg/day
- Phase 2: 20 mg/day
- Phase 3: 40 mg/day

## Monensin

This will require making a dilute solution, putting the solution into a dry
carrier substance, and evaporating the solvent. The solvent will be made with
10 mg solute and 10 mL 75.5% ethanol solvent, resulting in a 1 mg/mL solution.
With the calibrated 50.83+/-0.65 drops/mL of 75.5% ethanol measured on June 29th,
1 drop will be 19.7+/-0.2 ug.

Each drop is placed on a single cat treat and allowed to dry, leaving behind the
monensin.

- Phase 1: 2 drops (39.4 ug)/day
- Phase 2: 4 drops (78.8 ug)/day
- Phase 3: 5 drops (98.5 ug)/day

## Fenofibrate

- Phase 1: 12 mg/day
- Phase 2: 25 mg/day
- Phase 3: 50 mg/day
